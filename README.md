# Overview

I am a Software Developer trying expand my learning in programming.

This is an Expense and Budget Control System coded in React as a Frontend framework, TypeScript and Tailwinds CSS for styling.

The program was created to demonstrate my skills in React, Tailwinds CSS and Typescript. I create a Form, use the array structure to access the categories expenses, Context API in react to improve performance globaly in the program and not call props at any time; I also created a custum Hook to concentrate the diferents actions in one place. I implemented useMemo instead of useCallback to best redeability and Local Storage to save the data.
