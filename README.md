# Overview

I am a Software Developer trying expand my learning in programming.

This is an Expense and Budget Control System coded in React as a Frontend framework, TypeScript and Tailwinds CSS for styling.

The program was created to demonstrate my skills in React, Tailwinds CSS and Typescript. I create a Form, use the array structure to build the program, Context API in react to improve performance, and Local Storage to save the data.
